# Introduction{-}
Using a tool like [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) to write scientific papers makes our work more transparent and reproducible. It also reduces the risk of errors, because we can dynamically insert tables, figures, and summary statistics directly from the data they are generated from, rather than transferring results manually from statistical software to manuscript.

This example illustrates how to use the latest ACM \LaTeX\ templates (Version 1.55, from September 11, 2018) in tandem with R Markdown to write papers for the CHI conference, in the CHI proceedings format. In this example, I mostly follow the content in the sample-sigchi.tex example from the ACM template, illustrating how to create this content through the R Markdown workflow.

# Paper meta data
We set meta data of the paper (copyright, authors, keywords, title, keywords, optional teaser figure) in the YAML header of the .Rmd file. This is in the form of simple `key: value` pairs, for example `title: Writing CHI Proceedings Papers With R Markdown`. When compiling to a PDF, the information in the YAML header is plugged into the LaTeX template (which is itself specified in the YAML header with `template: sample-sigchi.tex`), for example `\title{$title$}`.

Note the sole **exception**: The CCS Concepts would be rather messy to insert from the YAML header, so I suggest you insert this directly into the sample-sigchi.tex template.

# The Body of The Paper
Typically, the body of a paper is organized into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even smaller sections.  Whereas in \LaTeX\ you'd use the command `\section` for main sections, in R Markdown you simply use `#`, as in `# The Body of The Paper`. For subsections, or sub-subsections, use more hashes, as in `## This Become a Subsection`, and `#### This Becomes a Paragraph Heading`.^[By the way, this is how to insert footnotes.] 

The compilation to PDF still is done via \LaTeX\, which handles their numbering and placement. If you want some section to be unnumbered in the output, add `{-}` after the section name, as in `# Unnumbered Section{-}`.

Indicate the start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.
This line, however, does not form a separate paragraph.

## Type Changes and *Special* Characters

Make words or phrases *italicized* by surrounding them with a single \*; **embolden** them by surrounding them with \*\***two**\*\*. `Typewriter-style` (for instance, for computer code) you create by  surrounding text with `` `backticks` ``.^[Another footnote here. Let's make this a rather long one to see how it looks.]

## Math Equations
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles: inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are discussed in the next sections. You can use usual \LaTeX\ syntax directly, 

### Inline (In-text) Equations
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
**math** environment, which can be invoked by surrounding text with dollar signs: \$. You can use any of the symbols and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in \LaTeX\. For example, here's a nice equation inline: $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0$. If you're writing in RStudio, you can even hover over it to see the rendered output displayed!

### Display Equations
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the text and centered horizontally---is produced by using \LaTeX\ syntax directly to put the content in an `equation` environment. So here's that nice equation from above:
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}.

In fact, you can use any arbitrary \LaTeX\ syntax directly in your .Rmd document.

To make an unnumbered display equation, just surround the expression with two dollar signs:
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
$$

## Citations
Citations to articles [@bowman:reasoning; @braams:babel; @Cohen07], conference proceedings [@clark:pct] or maybe books [@Lamport:LaTeX; @salas:calculus] listed in the Bibliography section of your article will occur throughout the text of your article. You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography; you simply need to insert the citation command: \@ followed by the citation key. The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely identify each work. This identifying key is included with each item in the `.bib` file for your article.

For example, to cite the article "Deciding equivalances among conjunctive aggregate queries" from our `.bib` file, we write `[@Cohen07]`[@Cohen07]. If we drop the the `[`s, we get the actual name of the authors, in addition to the citation: @Cohen07. See [this short guide](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).

## Tables
<!--Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite. To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.-->
<!-- Immediately following this sentence is the point at which Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of this document. -->

For tables, you could use \LaTeX\ syntax directly. This might be ok if your table is using \LaTeX\ syntax in there:

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

However, R Markdown shines in letting you read in your data and then automatically insert that into LaTeX tables, bypassing errors introduced via transferring data manually into a table. We can do that by inserting chunks (with three backticks) that runs code (could be R, Python, or something else), which is executed at the point of compilation and inserted into our final document:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r basket-data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data <- read_csv("fakeBasketData.csv")
data %>%
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "The first 5 rows of some made-up basket data.")
```

We can reference Table \@ref(tab:basket-data) with `\@ref(fig:basket-data)`.

Rather than saving out separate steps of the results, we can also do transformations of the same data and display it (see Table \@ref(tab:basket-summary):

```{r basket-summary, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data %>%
  group_by(Player) %>%
  summarise(`Total goals scored` = sum(goals)) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Summary statistics of goals scored by top players in made-up basketball season.")
```


To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's live area, we put it in a `\table*` environment, like so (see Table \@ref(tab:basket-wide))

```{r basket-summary-wide, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data %>%
  group_by(Player) %>%
  summarise(`Total goals scored` = sum(goals),
             `Goals per game` = `Total goals scored` / n()) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Bigger display of more summary statistics of goals scored by top players in made-up basketball season.", table.env = 'table*')
  
```

## Figures
Figures we similarly include via code chunks. We can just include arbitrary images, as in Figure \@ref(fig:static-image). If you don't give it a caption in the chunk options, it won't float.

```{r static-image, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Here's a little pretty fly."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/fly.eps")
```

```{r static-image-resized, echo=FALSE, out.height='1in', out.width='1in', fig.cap="A sample black and white graphic that has been resized with the \\texttt{out.height} and \\texttt{out.width} chunk options."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/fly.eps")
```

At the moment, if you need to style text in the caption, or include references in the captions, you need to use \LaTeX\ rather than markdown syntax to do so. As the figure caption is a string, you must use another `\` to escape the beginning `\` when doing so, as I did in Figure \@ref(fig:static-image-resized).

Again, however, the power of using R Markdown derives from the fact that you can include e.g. plots that are dynamically generated from the underlying data at the point of compiling the document. So we might want to make some visualisation of the basket data, as in Figure \@ref(fig:basket-plot). Note that we restrict its size to the column width.

```{r basket-plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Total number of goals by the top 3 players in made-up basketball season", out.width='0.98\\columnwidth'}
data %>%
  group_by(Player) %>%
  summarise(total_goals = sum(goals)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_goals)) %>%
  head(3) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = Player, y = total_goals), stat = "identity") +
    labs(x = "", y = "Total goals") + 
    theme_minimal()
```

As was the case with tables, you may want a figure that spans two columns.  To do this, set the environment to `figure*` by using `fig.env = 'figure*'` in the chunk options. If your image is large, restrict its width to the text width with `out.width='0.98\\textwidth'`.


```{r basket-plot-wide, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of goals scored by game for all recorded player in made-up basketball season", fig.env = 'figure*', out.width='0.98\\textwidth'}
data %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(y = goals, x = Player)) +
    geom_point(aes(y = goals, x = Player), position = "jitter") +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "", y = "Goals in game") +
    theme_minimal()
```


\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}

Other common constructs that may occur in your article are the forms
for logical constructs like theorems, axioms, corollaries and proofs.
ACM uses two types of these constructs:  theorem-like and
definition-like.

Here is a theorem:
\begin{theorem}
  Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
  an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
  \begin{displaymath}
    \int^b_af(t)\,dt = G(b) - G(a).
  \end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

Here is a definition:
\begin{definition}
  If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
  unique number that has
  logarithm $z$:
  \begin{displaymath}
    \log e^z = z.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

The pre-defined theorem-like constructs are \textbf{theorem},
\textbf{conjecture}, \textbf{proposition}, \textbf{lemma} and
\textbf{corollary}.  The pre-defined de\-fi\-ni\-ti\-on-like constructs are
\textbf{example} and \textbf{definition}.  You can add your own
constructs using the \textsl{amsthm} interface~\cite{Amsthm15}.  The
styles used in the \verb|\theoremstyle| command are \textbf{acmplain}
and \textbf{acmdefinition}.

Another construct is \textbf{proof}, for example,

\begin{proof}
  Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
  \begin{displaymath}
    \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
  \end{displaymath}
  Then
  \begin{displaymath}
    l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
    = \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
    \left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
    = \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
    \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
  \end{displaymath}
  which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.
%\end{document}  % This is where a 'short' article might terminate



\appendix
%Appendix A
\section{Headings in Appendices}
The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
the body of the article are different in the appendices.
In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
\textbf{section} is used to
indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
designation (i.e., the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
hierarchical structure
\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
document in Appendix-appropriate form:
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
\subsubsection{Math Equations}
\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\paragraph{Display Equations}
\subsubsection{Citations}
\subsubsection{Tables}
\subsubsection{Figures}
\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
\subsection{Conclusions}
\subsection{References}
Generated by bibtex from your \texttt{.bib} file.  Run latex,
then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
to create the \texttt{.bbl} file.  Insert that \texttt{.bbl}
file into the \texttt{.tex} source file and comment out
the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
% This next section command marks the start of
% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
